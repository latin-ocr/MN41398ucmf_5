THE CELTIC GOSPELS Ἰ lvii

parasceuen conante (Mt. xxvii. 62). This line is fuller in letters
than the average in St. Matthew. The letters areos necessity ’
not quite as round; a feature which can be seen‘in St. Marln
and St. Luke, where the printed text shows there are more letters
to the lines. It seems to me that as the scribe was within a
solio or so of finishing St. Matthew‚ another scribe who was to
follow with St. Mart< and St. Luhe tried his pen, so as to main· ,
tain continuity os script, ior the rask of taking over the work of
the first scribe.

ln Mc. i. 1-Lc. iii. 9 the script seerns to be lighter, the letters
not so round or large, and the general effect more refined.

vOn the other hand lt is possible that the style ol the scribe
was changed just as his text suas changed (p. 23, l. 18, ch p. 217,
l. 9). On the whole I arn under the irnpr‘ession that there were
two hands engaged on the work, one for St. lllatthew and the
other lor St. Mark and St. Luke. Dean Savage also appears to
be ol the opinion that there are traces ol two hands:

‘At the end of St. Mark's Gospel, where a large part of the page was
left blank, the Lord's Pruyer has been subsequently written in a differ·

ent but very similar handuriting, and therefore presumably not by the
original copyist31

Howevers the handwriting of the sacred text is so similar
throughout the MS. that, apart from expert opinion of palaeo-
grapbers, which apparently has not been given yet, we are left
with impressions rather than certainties. '
