tta Derivntimr of rte Celtic Text.

In the Celtic Gospels, as we shall see, we find traces of all these
types, and of others unknown to us. The fact that the Celtic x
type includes a large number of ‘ African’ readings points to the
fact that such readings represent in the insular Gospels an earlier
stage of the European texts than those of b and others.

We know of nothing which would lead us to suppose that St.
Augustine¹s reference to the endless variety of translators (‘ lati-
norum interpretum infinita varietas’) refers to Africa alone. It
is possible that the Gospels were translated at several places in
the West at about the same time, ancl thatthe resemblance ’
between most of the texts may be due to the recensions of later
times. Both Professor Turner and Canon Streeter doubt the
exclusively African origin of the ‘ African' texts.1
