As compared with the Hereford Gospels the contractioris 21
Teilo=Chad 212 lew. A fairly full list 21 both will be found in
Professor Lindsay's Early Welrlr script, and numerous references
to them are contained in the notes.

Dr, Scrivener is serere with our scribe 1211112 twenty-six
homoeoteleuta, but whether the scribe was responsible 121 thern
is another matter The omissions 12 11112126 and vii. 17 are
shared with D. We cannot judge 21 the omissions in 1111111
and 12 because the text 21 D is missing here. The homoeote- ·
leuta 21 Mc. x. 4 23, 24, and xi, 26 212 22121222 with r2, and xi.
26 with 1 2211 l as well. Nor can wc judge the negligente of our
scribe in lllt. viii. 27 (33), xix. 13,because the text 21 az is missing
in all these places. The omission in iv. 31 is common with gat,
and Mc. xv. 14 with the uncorrected G. In Mt. vi. athe omission

as the same words 212 omitted again in verse 18. Here again
the telrtof r2 is missing. We are now lest with the homoeoteleuta
21 lllt. xxvi. 37, 38, xxvii. 5-6, llllc. x. 32, 38, xii. 4, 5, xiv. 55,
56, and it is quite possible that some 21 these 212 due to the
scribe's exemplar and not to his carelessness in transcribing.

The 222222122221222211221211 22111212 motives 21 economy
of space but, as amongst the Jews from motives 21 1211212222.2
‘Spiritus’ and ‘dominus' are, however, sometimes contracted
even when they are not 2221122 sacru.

through the carelessness 21 the scribe.

Something must be said about contractiori by suspension >

which here and there meets us in our text. This is one 21 the
earliest forms 21 22211221122, where the scribe holds his pen and
leaves the 11221 letters to be supplied. It points to the great
antiquity 21 the llS., greater than is generally supposed, 121 11 12
