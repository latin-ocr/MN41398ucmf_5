less than thirty MSS. 01 the cuspus, and not in all 01 these ina

complete 101111,
I shall endeavour to show how large a proportion 01 this Old

Latin text, the ‘Old Vulgate’ as Cardinal Wiseman called it, or
the ‘old Vulgar Latin’ as it is termed by the Reims translator-s,
lies at the base not only 01 St. Jerome’s revision but of our
'British texts 01 Llandaff= Lichfield and Hereford.

These ancient British texts contain Old Latin readings 110111
MSS. which have perished and which in theirturnrnost probably
represent readings in GreekslllSS. 01 which no trace can to-day
be found. The tongue in which they were written is none the
worse for being that 01 Imperial Rome, which had become the
sermo vulgaris 01 the BritonS, nt a'period when this country

had. been subject to a Roman occupatiori 01 three centuries and
a half.
