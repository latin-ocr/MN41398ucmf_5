CHAPTER VI
THE SOURCESOF THE CELTIC TEXT

ITwould be natural to suppose that the Churches of Britain
and Ireland received their text of scripture from the same place
whence came their saith and order. Our insulartraditions derive ’
our Christianity from Gaul, at least the strength and support of
it, if not its origin. The earliest records of the diocese oi Llan-
’ dail connect it with the missionsof St. Germanusof Auxerre and
St. Lupus of Troyes, and we were always taught to look to the
Christian schools of St. Martin ol Tours fot the model os our
great religious foundations ol Llantwit Major, Llancartan, and
Llandough, which maintained much intercourse with the lrish
monasteries.

St. Patrick is said to have taken MSS. of the Scriptores to
Ireland from Le'rins which formed the foundation of the old
lrish texts soon to be so mingled with the text of Britain as to
make it scarce possible to distinguish between them.

The insular text has to be considered from two points of Ἴ
view:

i. The European Old Latin text of the Celtic recension of the
British isles, as evidenced by Archbishop Ussher's codex
lmown as v, and ¹

ii. The mixed text, having an Old Latin base but corrected
time and again to bring it into greater conformity with the
Vulgate.

The work ol Dom Chapman in his Early History os tte Vul-
gata Gamala ol llllr. Haddan in Coruum arrd Ecclesiastico
Damnatus (vol. i), and of M. Bonnassieux in his Las Evarrgiles
syuopriques dr Salat Hiram dc Porum has enabled us to trace
many of its readings to the schools ofLerins and of Gaul, as well

as to the writings of Gildas in Britain. Gaul remained sor a long
time iaithsul to the Old Latin texts.

’ There is a danger of laying undue stress on M. Berger‘s argu-
ment that the progress oi the Vulgate in the British lsles was
commensurate with the advance of the Roman Choreb, ior we
must bear in mind that even in Rome the ancient version con-
tinued to be used late in the fifth century, and in the sixth Pope
