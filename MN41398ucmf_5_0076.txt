INTRODUCTION

Tae Cotton MS. Otlru cv.

Described as a Saxon MS. ol the eighth century, this codex has
been almost destroyed by burning, bnt the recovery and mounting
ol the fragment has been very vell done.

Tlae Badium Guspels.

Ι expected to find a Celtic text in the Cornish MS. commonly
called tte Budruin Caspels, otherwise tlte Guspels uf St. Petrae
(Additional 9381). Like Teilo = Chad it contains records ot
the manumissions os seris aud other matters. But its text is
much luter and is more of the Vulgate type. Its script seems
to have but serv features os the Celtic school, though M. Berger
says that its g’s and r’s are oi the irish family ; but on the other
hand Bradshavv describes it as ‘a purely French MS. as sar as
the text is concerned '. Berger dates it as of the tenth century.
It is very easy to read, and Ι found that in Mt. viii and ix it
agrees with the variations of Teilo = Cliad to the extent of
to per cent.

Cotton M S. Tiberius A. Π,

ma us. otherwise n. α. a (see cat. aaa nass. aaa, pp?
35-7), is another oi King Athelstan¹s gilts, and is still more
vulgatized than the Cornish Gospels, as we should expect, for
while the Cornish MS. 'consonus more closely to the Vulgate
spelling than the MSS. of the British = Irish group in general,
many oi its readings belong to that group. Its position is the
reverse to that ol the Echtcrnach MS„ for its marginal readings
and corrections conform more closely to the Vulgate, while its
orthography is that of the Celtic school.

additionum. 6408 (f. 69).

This contains “specimina evangelistarii pervetusti in bibl.
eccles. Cathed. de Lichfield’‚ and gives a partial collation os
the text ol Teilo = Chad made in the early years oi the nine-
teenth century by one os the -Canons, nith some description
ol the MS. . Ι have also areference to Add. MS. 6211 but have
lost the connexion. Referenceto Add. MS. 36279 has been given
above on p. xviii.
