lii INTRODUCTION

distinctions between the first hand of the MS„ its corrections
and marginal readings, are too complicated to he set forth here.
The symbol ol the MS. is Η), but it is more commonly known
on the Contlnent by ept. It is generally in agreement with E,
and comes high on my list in support ol the variant readings ol
Tello z Chad and Hereiord.

St. Gattau of Tonas, commonly known as gat, was in the Ash-
burnham Library and is now at Paris.¹ Unlike the Insular MSS„
gat, which also belongs to the Celtic family, does harlc back to
Old Latin and Insular readings from a text which is already
‘mixed ἱ The scribe is lond os introducing them, with others
from the Vulgate as well, under the coverlng word ‘ uell’ between
the lines and above the wind or words sor which these marginalia
are alternatiwes, just as was done in the bilingual llllS. at St. Gall
(ὃ), St. Gatian supports the variations of Teilo=Cbad to the ex·
tent ol 32 per cent, in St. llllatthew. In St. Mark, out ol the
1354 variations from the Clementine Vulgate, gat supports 498
or 36 per cent. ln two sections oi St. Luke l. 1 to iii. 9, wehaye
the lull text oi Teilo= Chad, her, r2, and gat together, viz. i. 17-

80 and ii. 1-15. Here our variations are supported to the extent
of 44 per cent. by Herelord 41 per cent. bygot, and 35 per cent.
by ⁷²2· From Luke iii. 9 to the end of that Gospel the Herelord
text varies from that os the Clementine Vulgare in 1‚978 places
and is supported ln 704 ol them by gat or to the extent oi
35 per cent.
