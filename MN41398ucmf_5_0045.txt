, THE VALUE OF THE LATIN VERSION

THE Latin Version is still the official Bible of hall the Christian
world. For a thousand years, as far as the West was concerned
it was the only Bible in ordinary use. The language onycliffe’s

Bible, though it was translated into English from the Vulgare
direct, does not seem very strange to the reader of the English
Bible oi to-day, and he who essays to translate from the Vulgate
now will findit difficult to depart far fromthe language oi the
Enghsh Bible¹ Wycliife’s Version was well known to our trans-
lators, and the Vulgate itself was the Bible on which they had
all been brought up and which¹ the elergy of the Reformation
period were expected to read.

Archbishop Cranrner published injunctions to the diocese
of Hereford during thevacancy ln the see in 1538, requiring each
clerk to provide himself with ‘a whole Bible in Latin and
English, orat least a New Testament of both these same lan-
guuges' and to ‘ study every day one chapter· ol the said Bible or
New Testament‚ conferring the Latin and English together '.
These injunctions were enforced in other places as well. Tyn-
dale's Bible was influenced by the Vulgate itseli‚ hythe German
translation lrorn the Latin, and by Wycliffe's phrases, which had
passed into the· common tongue, such as ‘ strait gate'‚ ‘narrow
way’, ‘ bearn and mote', and many others. Let any one read
Bishop Latirner's sermons and he will see how largea part the
Vulgate played in the texts oi scripture to which he refers. The
” sarne is true of the sermons ol Andrewes and Laud.

Apart irorn the traditional forms oi expression drawn from the
Vulgate at the back oi the minds os our translators when they
set to work on the revision of 1611, based upon earlier revisions
which had their roots in thegLatin text, there were other reasons
why the knowledge ol the Latin text had a great influence upon
the English translators from the Received Greek text. After
all, the oldest Latin texts are translations of the oldest Greek
texts, so that both Greek and Latin give the same ideas,
which had to be expressed in English by minds as conversant
