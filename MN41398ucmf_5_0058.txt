‘sic luceat lux uestra coram hominibus ut uideant uestra bona opera

et glorificent patrern uestrum qai in caelis est'
First it will be noticed that the European and Italian read ‘ lux
vestra’ lor the African ‘lumen uestrum’. Then the European
reads ‘magnificent' sor the African ‘clarificent '‚ but the italian
is satisfied with neither and substitutes ‘glor-ificent'. Finally,
the European reads ‘qui est in caelis’ for the African ‘qui in
caelis est' and the Italian agrees with the African against the
Enropean. ’

What then did St. Jerome correct? It all depends upon what
type he took for his base. Taking fas his base (il s is not the
Vulg‘ate itsell hut an Old Latin MS.) he altered nothing accord·
ing to the Clementiae text. Ii he took b as his base he would
also have altered nothing, except that he would have substituted
‘glorificent' ior ‘rnagnfficentl The truth is, as Kenyon has
said, ‘Jerorne's revision ol the Ν.Τ. was very partial and the
basis ol his text rernains Old Latin?1

Let us take another example. Mt. vii. 12:

Erimon (a and b).

‘Omnia ergo qaaecumque uultis at faciant uobis homines bona ita
et uos facite illis.¹

Vulgata.

‘Omnia ergo quaecumque uultis ut faciant vobis homines et uos
facite eis)

’ Here every word of the Vulgate is taken irorn the Old Latin
except that ‘eis' was substituted for ‘illis' and ‘bona ita' was
omitted. Where St. Jerorne rnade no alteration in the Old Latin
base, that base is not described as an Old Latin reading although
it really is ⁵03 but where he corrected the reading, that cor-
rection we call a Vulgate reading, and the reading displaced by
him we call an Old Latin reading, thus ‘bona ita' and‘illis’ are
Old Latin readings here.
