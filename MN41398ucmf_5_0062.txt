xxxvi INTRODUCTION

Here the text is neither AV. nor RV„ but very mixed. ‘Citi-
zenship' is RV. for the ΑΝ, ‘conversation '. The Rv. ‘we
wait for a Saviour' is not adopted, neither is ‘fashion anew'.
The AV. ‘our vile body' is discmded, but the Rv. ‘the body
oi our humiliation¹ is not the rendering that, is put in its
place. The bishops and scholars who revised the text in 1p28
did what the editors of the Celtic texts sometimes did (for
examples see Tetlo=Chad in lte. vi. 40, xiv. 44, and xv. 12):
went to the original Greeiz, translated afresh, and gave ‘the body
oi our low estate ', which is neither Ay. nor R.V.‚ just as the
Llandaff = Lichfield Gospels gave ‘persingulas arias', ‘ducite
cnm monitione', and ‘regi illi quem dicitis ¹, which are neither
Old Latin nor Vulgate. They gave up the A.V. ‘that it may be
fashioned lihe unto ¹ and did not adopt the Rv. ‘ that it may be
conformed to’ but rendered 'that it may be like unto '.

In the Gospel for the second Sunday alter Easter, the A.V.

base is taken in St. John x. 16, ‘and there shall be one sold and
one shephwd', but ‘flock' is substituted ior ‘sold' from the
Rv„ though ‘ tdey slzull become one flock' is not incorporated.
Here we have a mixture ol three texts in one verse: the av,
R.v.‚ and Rv. margin.
v For the Sunday next before Advent we have lor St. John vi.
14 ‘ when they had sech the sign that Jesus did '. The text is
AV. with the R.V. ‘sign' substituted for the Av. ‘miracle',
but the R.V. context ‘ When therefore the people saw the sign
which he did' is not used.

So did the revisers ol the Celtic Church. They simply took
from the Vulgate what suited their purpose. Sometimes they
adopted Jerome¹s orthography and forgot it in the next line.
Sometimes they clung to an archaic sorm, just as ‘ music ' is spelt
with a ‘k ¹ in the Revised Prayer Book text oi 1928, ‘he heard
musici< and dancing'‚ (The alternative Gospel sor the ninth
Sunday after Trinity-St. Luhe xv. 25)
