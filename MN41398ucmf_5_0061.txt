. THE CELTIC GOSPELS xxxv

The fallacy 011115 ὲ11011515 base' theory can be tested in

¹ aiew well known places
= In the LordsPrayer (Mt vi. 9- -trgt tthe toext fTei10= chad

= reads:

PATER NOSTER QUIES INCAELIS
SANCTIFICETUR NOMEN TUUM

' ET UENIET REGNUM TUUM
FIAT UOLUNTAS TUA

SICUT IN CAELO ET IN TERRA
PANEM NOSTRUM COTIDIANUM

DANOBIS ODIE

ET DIMITTE NOBIS DEBITA NOSTRA

SICUT ET NOS DEMITTIMUS DEBITORIBUS NOSTRIS
Ι ΕΤ ΝΕ NOS INDUCAS INTEMPTATIONEM

SED LIBERA NOS AMALO.

Now all this is Old Latin down to ‘sicut’‚ which is Vulgate—
the onlqulgate word in the Prayer—orone word infilty. Would
we say that this text had a Vulgate base?

Tahe again the first 01 the ‘Corniortable Words’ (Mt. xi. 28).
'Teilo=Chad reads: ‘Venite ad me ornnes qui laboratis et
honorati estis et ego reficiam 11053 With thc excepti0n 01 the

aspirare, the reading ol the Old Latin b is exactly the 551115.
The ‘Vulgate base* is generally found on examination to be
none other than 1115 base 01 the Vulgare.

Vulgate, and the text of the Revised Prayer Book 01 1918 (55 ’
