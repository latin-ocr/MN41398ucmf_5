This MS. is otherwise known as Codex Dublinensis, or D, fr'om
the lact that it is at 'Trinity coingenitum. Its scribe was
Ferdomnach ‘Heir ol Patrlck', a title which belonged to the
Abbots ancl Archbishops ol Armagh alone. He held the see
812-13, and the llllS. must have been copied, according to M.
Bergm, in 812. lts text bears a strong relationship to that of ’
the Spanish MSS. and has a large number ol conflate readings
ordoublcts. =

‘The Book of Armagh ’‚ says Dr. John Gwyn, who has given
us a magnificent edition of it, ‘stands lorth to the student of
Biblical literature without a rival in the whole rank ol Irish
antiquity‚ as the only entire New Testament as read ln the early
Irish Church‚'and copied by irish scribes, that is now extant.¹ Ἴ

Its text is missing lrom xiv. r to xix in St. llllatthew.
