SOME years ago the Dean and Chapter 01 Lichfield allowed
Sir John Balling <rent then Librarian 01 the Na tional Library 01 λ
Wales, ohave pho os at copres madeo he Book 01 St. Chad
which has been intheir possession 101 nearly at thousand years.
The Council 01 the National Library 01 Wales present ted one
copy to Lichfield Cathedral¹ which possesses the original, one to
Llandaff, the original home 01 the MS, and retained the third

Fortunately‚ however, there exists another MS. 01 the British
