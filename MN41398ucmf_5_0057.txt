THE OLD LATIN BASE OF THE VULGATE

THE term ‘Vulgate’ was taken over frorn the Greek for the
LXX, called the Vulgate of the Old Testament‚ and its trans-
ferente to the current Latin was easy and natural. ‘The Old

Latin itself was called the Vulgate before St.Jer0me¹s correction Ἴ

displaced it. Cardinal Wiseman called it Old Vulgate to distin-
guish it frorn St. jerome's new Vulgate. St. jerome used the
term to indicate the most prevalent forins of text in use in his
time. Roger Baeon in the thirteenth century seems the first to
have applied it to St. Jerorne’s revision.

Before we venture on our quest for the origins of the Celtic,
Britishzlrish or lnsurar (British isles) text we must be sure
what we mean by an Old Latin reading, as we shall meet the
term frequently. A pure Old Latin text would be one that had
never been revised by St. Jerome. li it be a text bearing all the
marles of his correction it is a pure Vulgare, though its base is

Old Latin. lf, however, those corrections were only partially
adopted the result would bea mixed text. Let us take one or
two verses to illustrate the different types of the Latin texts.
