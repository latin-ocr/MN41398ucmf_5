SOME CELTIC CODICES

Tlre Dalmata Airgr'd.

THIS Irish MS. takes its name lrom the silver reliquary ‘the
silver ehureh ' in which it was enshrined. It appears that it was
not there originally, lor the Domnaeh was said to contain a lock
oi the V-irgin Mary's hair and other relies, so there would have
been no room for it. All that is known is that it was found there.
Its story has been told by Dr. Bernard in the T rarrraclr'orts af the
Raynl frist llccwlemyJ vol. XXX, parts vii ancl viii (1893).

The leaves ol the MS, are fastened together by damp¹ and
Dr Graves described it in 1861 as ‘a solid mass oi wrinkled
iolios agglutinated together ¹, but skilled workmen at the British
lluseum have since been able to open out 39 of the 150 wrinkled
fullos so that they ean be read. These leaves eontain certain
portions of Mt. i. 1-v. 25, Mc. i—iv. 12, Le. i. 6-ii. 25, and Jo.
i. t-iv. 14. The vellum is thick and the leaves are ruled wtth
ar. lines to a page as compared with ao ior Teilo = Chad to
which it is remarkably alike both in script, spelling, and the
general format ol the page. ln some places the scribe appears
to have left out whole lines (el. wtt. i. 15 ; lile. ii. a ; iii. 31 5 Jo. i.
50). There are occasional capitals at the beginning of impor-
tant sections, and the writing is continnous and uhilorm.

The following specimens ol orthography are given :

inlussus : babtizo : rapbi ι opbrobtium .· profeta : larissei : diabulus t
,scisurazhoreum v

The text is ‘mixed ', and among the variants are:

Mt. iii. 5 om. et omnis Iudaea.
Mc. i. 1 est lor eins.
Mc, iii. 15 add. ut circum(euntes predicalren(t euang)elium.
Mc. iii. ²7 quoniam belzebud habet et qnia in principe est demonio-
rum (in iurlorem.
